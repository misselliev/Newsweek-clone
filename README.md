<h1 id="next-clone">Newsweek clone</h1>

<p>Sixth project of the <a href="https://www.microverse.org/">Microverse</a> curriculum from the CSS3 and HTML section.</p>

<p>In this project, we got a chance to try out Twitter’s Bootstrap framework by building a site that actually uses it</p>

You can look at the original site [here](https://www.newsweek.com/).
